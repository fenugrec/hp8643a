collection of funcs for working with HP 8643A ROMs

Currently hardcoded and tested for one ROM dump, with ICs
	08643-87301
	08643-87302
	08643-87303
	08643-87304
labelled "3449" as well on the stickers, but reports as "Rev 4.2.1" when booting.

The ROM checksum is a 16-bit sum, calculated over 4 areas :
0 to +0x20000, except 8 bytes at 0x400-0x0407
20000 to 40000
40000 to 60000
60000 to 70000 (only testing half of the last IC which is empty anyway)
Checksums are stored in those 8 reserved bytes at 0x400.
